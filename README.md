
Sonic Lineup
============

#### An application for comparative visualisation and alignment of related audio recordings

Sonic Lineup is an application for quick read-only comparative
visualisation of multiple audio files whose contents consist of
different performances of the same work or recordings of the same
material.

Although potentially useful for music study, rehearsal, musicological
purposes, or language learning, the application is still in an
exploratory experimental state at the moment.
